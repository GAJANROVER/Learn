# -------------- variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
# print(x)

y = int(3)  #If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
# print(type(y))  # You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

"""
----------- Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords. """


# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"

# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Apple", "Banana"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# One Value to Multiple Variables
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"
# print(x, y ,z)

g = 'hey'
# print(g, x)

# Global Variable
# If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
# To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
# def myFunc():
#     global a
#     a = 'developer'
#     g = 'gajan'
#     print(g + ' gtr')
#
# myFunc()
#
# print(g + ' gajan')
# print(g + " " +  a)

# Looping Using List Comprehension
# List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:

# copy list
# thislist1 = thislist.copy()

# To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
